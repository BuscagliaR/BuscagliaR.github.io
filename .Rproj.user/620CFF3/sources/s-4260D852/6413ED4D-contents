## [ESFuNC Algorithm](https://github.com/BuscagliaR/ESFuNC)

Ensemble of Segmented Functional Nonparametric Classifiers (ESFuNC) is a curve classification algorithm applied to the identification of disease based on clinical DSC.

- Ensemble learning applied to multivariate functional data to produce estimated classes.
- Train and test many segmented classifiers that are then mixed to improve estimation criterion (accuracy, AUC)
- Parallel computing to reduce computation burden
